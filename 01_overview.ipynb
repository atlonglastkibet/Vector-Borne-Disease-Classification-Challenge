    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vector borne diseases such as Dengue, Malaria, Lyme Disease, and West Nile Fever are major public health concerns globally. Early identification of these diseases can save lives and optimize treatment strategies. In this competition, your task is to build a machine learning model that can predict the most likely disease(s) a patient may have based on clinical and environmental features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will work with a synthetically generated tabular dataset that mimics real-world patterns of disease outbreaks and patient characteristics. This makes the task realistic and challenging, while ensuring data privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use case: Such models can be integrated into early warning systems for hospitals or public health departments to improve disease response strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The prediction target is the prognosis — which refers to the predicted vector borne disease(s) associated with each patient ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetically-Generated Datasets\n",
    "- Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submissions will be evaluated based on MPA@3. Each submission can contain up to 3 predictions (all separated by spaces), and the earlier a correct prediction occurs, the higher score it will receive.\n",
    "Submission File\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each id in the test set, you must predict the target prognosis. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "    id,prognosis\n",
    "    707,Dengue West_Nile_fever Malaria\n",
    "    708,Lyme_disease West_Nile_fever Dengue\n",
    "    709,Dengue West_Nile_fever Lyme_disease\n",
    "    etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal is to maximize MAP@3, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ranking the correct label(s) higher improves your score.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Submissions with the correct disease ranked in the top 3 will score, with higher weight given to those ranked earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "    Start Date - April 18, 2023\n",
    "    Entry Deadline - Same as the Final Submission Deadline\n",
    "    Team Merger Deadline - Same as the Final Submission Deadline\n",
    "    Final Submission Deadline - May 1, 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary."
